# ClearSkies

**A chrome extension for smooth web sailing**

To make users able to have a smooth web-surfing experience, as stress and bully-free as sailing through clear skies. The perfect version would have an AI sentiment analyzer to determine all the triggering words and insults, which would be starred out by asterisks. Those asterisks would signal to the user to just keep scrolling and  not bother trying to read that particular sentence/comment.
