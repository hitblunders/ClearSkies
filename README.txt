To run Clear Skies extension, please clone the repository.

Open Google Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/

Make sure Developer Mode is on by sliding the slider on the top right of the screen.

On the top left of the screen, click on "Load Unpacked" and navigate to where you clonned the repository. Select that folder and click okay.

Now our "extension" is installed on Chrome. Make sure its activated by comfirming that the little slider is blue.

This extension should work on all websites that aren't protected by encryptions (such as websites run by tech giants like Twitter and CNN).
However, it is recommended that you try seeing this extension run on [https://motivationmentalist.com/2014/02/11/the-wolf-of-wall-street-leonardo-dicaprio-speech/] because it is known for a fact that that page has words that the extension would censor.

Thank you.
